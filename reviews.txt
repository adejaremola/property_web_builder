- the site-map of the features didn't work. When adding a new
feature or updating a feature, the 'Features' part of the top
navigation (Home > Features > Add) links is not working. Same
for Property Type, Property State, and Currency

- Add this Instruction to the page for editing and adding new
currency
"Please supply the HTML Code for the currency. e.g. &#8358;
for Nigeria naira sign"

- Also, the raw HTML code for each symbol should be displayed
when editing a particular currency.

=============================
So about the site contents
- I will like you to design the migrations in this way:

Schema::create('site_contents', function (Blueprint $table) {
 $table->increments('id');
 $table->text('key')->nullable();
 $table->text('value')->nullable();
 $table->timestamps();
});

just a key-value pair. It is more flexible that way.
I will also like to point out that, instead of this:

$about = SiteContents::where
(['id'=>SiteContents::SITE_CONTENT_ID])->first()->value
('about');

You could have used this:

$about = SiteContents::select("about")->first();

make the changes and create a new PR.
